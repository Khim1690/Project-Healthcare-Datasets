# HealthCare Datasets-projects

### Why I Did This Project

I wanted to explore healthcare data because hospital billing and patient stay patterns are interesting real-world problems. Healthcare data can be complex, so I used this project to practice analyzing real structured data.

### What This Project Is About

 I analyzed healthcare data to understand relationships between:

(1) Length of hospital stay

(2) Billing amount

(3) Patient-related variables

I wanted to see if longer stays really mean higher bills and how different factors affect cost.

### Tools I Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

### What I Did

Loaded the dataset

Checked for missing values

Cleaned incorrect data


Explored relationships between variables

For example:
I created a box plot between length of stay and billing amount to see if there was a pattern.

### What I Learned

Healthcare data can be messy and complex. I learned how to look for relationships between variables instead of just looking at numbers.

This project improved my understanding of correlation and data visualization.
